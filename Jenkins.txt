Jenkins:
--------
Continuous integration tool (build + deployment + testing)
Developed using JAVA
Jenkins.war (web application) need web server or app server

HTTP Request/Response takes place:
----------------------------------
client --> browser 
server --> unix (web container "JRE" + tomcat server)

* Once request is made, tomcat will search for a web application and gives response back

Jenkins installation requirements:
----------------------------------
* Tomcat Server (catalina home path)
* Java (jre home path)
https://jenkins.io/ and download war file
jenkins.war

* move jenkins.war to /tomcat/webapps directory 

* Once u start the tomcat server tomcat/bin/startup.sh, it will automatically will create Jenkins folder 

* Inorder to confirm whether tomcat server is running,
ps -ef | grep java

* Check which port is used by tomcat server
netstat -anp | grep java 
eg: 8080

* Now go to apache tomcat server page localhost:8080 
* use jenkins, then localhost:8080/jenkins

In root directory, .jenkins will get created and contains many folders (jobs, plugins)

Now Login to tomcat server, manager option, u will see deploy option (here u can directly
deploy war file)

* if you want to restart your jenkins, then localhost:8080/jenkins/restart

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Need to add JAVA and ANT into Jenkins:
--------------------------------------
Manage Jenkins --> configure system --> Add JAVA (give java home) --> Add ANT () --> Save it

In .jenkins directory, $echo JAVA_HOME --> eg: jdk 1.8 path will come
In .jenkins directory, $echo ANT_HOME --> eg: ant 1.9 path will come

Create Jobs:
------------
Click New Item (New job name) --> click freestyle project
In config: give SVN path --> svn+ssh://hostname/opt/svn/helloworld
(where is our project is existed)
there will be subversion authentication (username/password)

In Build Section --> add build setup --> Invoke ANT --> select ANT version --> 
select build.xml from helloworld project  -- target = ALL (complete build process)

In Post build options section --> if u want to get notifications (build is successfull)

SAVE it....

Once done then click on BUILD NOW option (checkout project from SVN and then build)
CONSOLE OUTPUT option displays step by step done.

Workspace directory is created in .jenkins section.
