SVN:
--------
Sub Version: check in and check out

* Repository maintains for safety side and contains project code.
* Hard disk in one machine

SVN  repository 													Developer 1
---------------------                                                    ------------------																					
Project 1 -----------------check out ------------> Project 1
(File 1 int x=0)														* he must have credentials to repository
																					1. URL
																					2. username
																					3. password

(File 1 int x=100)   <------checkin/commit------File 1 (int x=100) modifies by Developer 1
																					
																					
																					Developer 2
																					-------------------
																					He must always get updated code before code
																				
																				
How will you know if the code is changed?
---------------------------------------------------------
SVN -- there will be star mark after editing and not matched with repository
CVS -- arrow mark

Right click the File --> Replace with --> Latest repository

For comparing code:
-----------------------------
Right click file --> compare with --> Local history --> Versions will come

Whenever commiting the code we always change the version.
In project we have build.properties --> project.version --> 11.0.37 (change it here)

Local history == repository history.....

Checkout a project in Eclipse:
---------------------------------------------
Select import --> checkout projects from SVN -->

In CVS:
----------
1. host and username and password

In Clear Case:
--------------------
we have locking mechanism, if developer 1 is working on File 1, then the developer 2 is cannot work on File1


SVN Repository Layout:
------------------------------------
1. Trunk 			2. Branches 			3. Tags

Trunk: used for development phase

branch: (for release activities)
* Once the development is completed, we need to create a branch 
to happen release activities from trunk.

Tag: Labeling the released versions
* Once the final build is released, we create an archive/label called tag
representing the code version which is released

For Post release activities like maintainence, hard fix delivery then we need to create a 
branch from tag.


Trunk   (Dev complete) ------ > Branch (Prepare for release)

Step1:
Right click trunk folder ---> svn --> click branch/tag --> Give path /branches/app-1.0 
--> message  -- >Choose latest (HEAD) or specific revision --> commit

Now revision number is increased.

Every change in SVN is recognized using revision number.

Step 2: checkout code from branch into trunk folder -- > make changes and commit back
in branch path

Step 3: Now release, right click app-1.0 folder --> create tag /tags/app-1.0-release --> commit

step4: if any changes after release, checkout code from tag and create branch app-1-hotfix/fixpipe
Like windows updates 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONFLICT --- MERGE CONFLICT: 
Working on the release branch: tag
-------------------------------------------------

* making a change in file -- commit into branch 
* make one more commit into branch itself

Now we merge, take trunk --  click SVN update -- see log --done merge  (revision is 5-7)
Latest revision number is called HEAD

make a Revision range to merge (7 to 10) -- merge
url to merge from: branches/app-1.0
working copy is trunk

right click for diff or compare with

* Finally commit the changes "done the merge from revisions
7-10 and committed them to repos " 

develop ++ trunk --> file.txt ----> making a change and commit (rev-12)
testing ++ app 1.0 --> file.txt ----> making a chnage and commit (rev-13)

now if i merge from app 1.0 to trunk, 
check for last revision range in log which was (7-10)
now we need to merge revision from 10-13
conflict comes --- it will make a change in the source (app 1.0) and apply in the 
destination

now you have made a change in both source and destination,
SVN got confused in merge, and asking us to resolve
Click resolve all later --- merge finished and show which one is conflicted
You can right click edit conflict --- will show the problem

theirs is testing team (app 1.0) we can see change done in line number 8
mine is develop team (trunk) we can see change in line number same 8

it will ask configuration generar to help coordinate with develop team
right click on line --- use this test block
										use text block from theirs before mine
conflict resolved now first testing line and then devlop line will come

now commiting from root which holds trunk and app 1.0-release
 "merge from 10-13 and the changes are commited" rev 14 will come
